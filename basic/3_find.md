# MongoDB `mongosh` Find

## Overview

MongoDB provides two methods to retrieve data from a collection: `find()` and `findOne()`.

---

## The `find()` Method

The `find()` method is used to select multiple documents from a collection. By default, if no query is specified, it returns **all documents** in the collection.

### Usage
```javascript
db.collection.find()
```

Example:
```javascript
db.Tuts.find()
```

---

## The `findOne()` Method

The `findOne()` method retrieves a single document from a collection. If no query is provided, it returns the **first document** it finds.

### Usage
```javascript
db.collection.findOne()
```

Example:
```javascript
db.Tuts.findOne() // Returns the first document in the collection
```

---

## Querying Data

You can filter or query data by passing a query object to either `find()` or `findOne()`. This query object specifies the criteria for selecting documents.

### Example
To find documents where the `category` field is `"News"`:
```javascript
db.Tuts.find({ category: "News" })
```

---

## Using Projection

Both `find()` and `findOne()` methods accept an optional **projection parameter**. Projection allows you to control which fields to include or exclude in the results.

- **Include a field**: Use `1`
- **Exclude a field**: Use `0`

> **Note**: You cannot mix `0` and `1` values in the same projection object, except for the `_id` field, which can be excluded (`_id: 0`) even if other fields are included.

### Example: Including Specific Fields
To include only the `title` and `date` fields in the results:
```javascript
db.Tuts.find({}, { title: 1, date: 1 })
```

Output:
```plaintext
[
  { _id: ObjectId("67202a8e4d7f3b332dfe6911"), title: "Example Title", date: "2023-10-10" },
  { _id: ObjectId("67202b694d7f3b332dfe6912"), title: "Another Title", date: "2023-10-11" }
]
```

### Example: Excluding the `_id` Field
To exclude the `_id` field while including `title` and `date`:
```javascript
db.Tuts.find({}, { _id: 0, title: 1, date: 1 })
```

### Example: Mixing Include and Exclude - **Invalid**
The following will cause an error because it tries to include `title` and exclude `date` in the same projection object:
```javascript
db.Tuts.find({}, { title: 1, date: 0 }) // ❌ This will result in an error
```

By using these methods and options, you can efficiently retrieve and control the data returned from your MongoDB collections.
