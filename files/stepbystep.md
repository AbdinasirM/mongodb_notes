# MongoDB GridFS with PyMongo: File Storage Guide

This guide explains how to use MongoDB's GridFS with PyMongo to store, retrieve, and manage large files in a MongoDB database. GridFS splits files into smaller chunks and manages metadata, allowing you to store files of any type (text, images, videos, etc.) directly in MongoDB.

## Prerequisites

1. **MongoDB** installed and running.
2. **PyMongo** installed in your Python environment.

   ```bash
   pip install pymongo
   ```

## Quick Overview

GridFS is used to store files larger than MongoDB's BSON document size limit (16 MB) or any file that you want to store in MongoDB in a manageable way. GridFS divides each file into chunks and saves each chunk in a MongoDB collection, along with file metadata.

### Key Features

- **Store any file type**: Text, image, video, ISO files, and more.
- **Automatic chunking**: Files are split into chunks, making large files manageable.
- **Metadata support**: Add custom metadata to each file for easier management.

## Setup

To start using GridFS with MongoDB and PyMongo, follow these steps:

1. **Connect to MongoDB**:
   
   ```python
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   import gridfs

   # Connect to MongoDB and select the database
   client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
   db = client["myfiles"]
   ```

2. **Create a GridFS Bucket**:

   ```python
   # Create a GridFS bucket
   bucket = gridfs.GridFSBucket(db)
   ```

   The bucket is where your files will be stored, split into chunks.

## 1. Upload Files to GridFS

You can upload any type of file, such as text files, images, videos, or ISO files, using `upload_from_stream` or `open_upload_stream`.

### Upload an Existing File

To upload an existing file, open it in binary mode and use `upload_from_stream`.

```python
with open("path/to/your/file.jpg", "rb") as file:
    file_id = bucket.upload_from_stream("file.jpg", file, metadata={"contentType": "image/jpeg"})
print("File uploaded with ID:", file_id)
```

- **"file.jpg"**: The filename in GridFS.
- **`file`**: The opened file object.
- **Metadata**: Optional. Here, we specify that it’s an image (`contentType`).

### Upload Dynamic Data

You can also create files with data generated at runtime using `open_upload_stream`.

```python
with bucket.open_upload_stream("runtime_file.txt", metadata={"contentType": "text/plain"}) as grid_in:
    grid_in.write("This is dynamically generated content.".encode("utf-8"))
```

## 2. Retrieve File Metadata

To view information about files in GridFS, use `find()` to list all files.

```python
for file_doc in bucket.find({}):
    print("File ID:", file_doc._id)
    print("Filename:", file_doc.filename)
    print("Size:", file_doc.length, "bytes")
    print("Upload Date:", file_doc.upload_date)
    print("Metadata:", file_doc.metadata)
    print("--------")
```

## 3. Download Files from GridFS

GridFS can retrieve files by name or by file ID. You can save them with the original filename or a custom one.

### Download by Filename

To download a file by its name and save it locally:

```python
filename = "file.jpg"  # The name in GridFS
with bucket.open_download_stream_by_name(filename) as grid_out:
    with open("downloaded_" + filename, "wb") as file:
        file.write(grid_out.read())
print(f"File downloaded successfully as 'downloaded_{filename}'")
```

### Download by File ID

If you have the file ID, use it to download the specific file.

```python
from bson import ObjectId

file_id = ObjectId("your_file_id_here")  # Replace with actual file ID
with bucket.open_download_stream(file_id) as grid_out:
    with open("downloaded_file.jpg", "wb") as file:
        file.write(grid_out.read())
print("File downloaded successfully as 'downloaded_file.jpg'")
```

## 4. Rename Files

To rename a file, use its file ID:

```python
from bson import ObjectId

bucket.rename(ObjectId("your_file_id_here"), "new_filename.txt")
print("File renamed successfully.")
```

## 5. Delete Files

To delete a file, use its file ID:

```python
bucket.delete(ObjectId("your_file_id_here"))
print("File deleted successfully.")
```

## Full Workflow Example

Here’s an example of the complete workflow:

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient
import gridfs
from bson import ObjectId

# Connect to MongoDB
client = MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
db = client["myfiles"]
bucket = gridfs.GridFSBucket(db)

# 1. Upload a file
with open("path/to/your/image.jpg", "rb") as file:
    file_id = bucket.upload_from_stream("image.jpg", file, metadata={"contentType": "image/jpeg"})
print("Uploaded file with ID:", file_id)

# 2. List files and metadata
for file_doc in bucket.find({}):
    print("File ID:", file_doc._id, "Filename:", file_doc.filename)

# 3. Download file by name
filename = "image.jpg"
with bucket.open_download_stream_by_name(filename) as grid_out:
    with open("downloaded_" + filename, "wb") as file:
        file.write(grid_out.read())

# 4. Rename the file
bucket.rename(file_id, "renamed_image.jpg")

# 5. Delete the file
bucket.delete(file_id)
```

## Notes

- **Binary Mode (`"rb"` and `"wb"`)**: Always open files in binary mode for reading and writing to ensure correct handling of binary data.
- **Metadata**: Adding `contentType` metadata can help organize and manage files.
- **Unique ID**: Each file in GridFS gets a unique `_id` you can use for file operations.

## Conclusion

This guide provides an easy-to-follow approach for managing files in MongoDB with GridFS and PyMongo. You can use GridFS to handle various file types, with options to upload, retrieve, rename, and delete files directly in MongoDB.
